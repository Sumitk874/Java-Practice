# Java DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java practice code for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a collection of my solutions to various DSA problems, exercises, and coding challenges implemented in Java.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on topics or problem-solving categories. The folder structure is as follows:

- `2d-array/`: Contains Java implementations of problems and exercises related to 2D arrays.
- `arrays/`: Contains Java implementations of problems and exercises related to arrays.
- `strings-and-stringbuilder/`: Contains Java implementations of problems and exercises related to strings and the `StringBuilder` class.
- `recursion-and-backtracking/`: Contains Java implementations of problems and exercises related to recursion and backtracking.

Feel free to explore the folders and source code to learn about different topics in DSA and find solutions to problems in Java.
